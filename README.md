# Music Analytics
This is a project that I am currently working on that will scrape and analyze information related to the previous year-end Hot 100 from Billboard.

As of this moment, The scaper will go to Billboard.com and pull the results for the hot 100 of 2020. The website only provides the title and the artist of the song, so that is what is pulled from the website.
